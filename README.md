# Overleaf Toolkit

This repository contains the Overleaf Toolkit, the standard tools for running a local
instance of [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com). This toolkit will help you to set up and administer both Overleaf Community Edition (free to use, and community supported), and Overleaf Server Pro (commercial, with professional support).

The [Developer wiki](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki) contains further documentation on releases, features and other configuration elements.
